function
This feature is experimental and may affect performance.
When this feature is turned on, you can zoom in and out by triple-tapping the screen. While zoomed in, you can: Pan: Drag two or more fingers across the screen.Adjust zoom level: Pinch two or more fingers together or spread them apart.You can also temporarily magnify what's under your finger by triple-tapping and holding. In this magnified state, you can drag your finger to explore different parts of the screen. Lift your finger to return to your previous state. Note: Triple-tap for magnification works everywhere except the keyboard and navigation bar.
When this feature is turned on, you can beam app content to another NFC-capable device by holding the devices close together. For example, you can beam Browser pages, YouTube videos, People contacts, and more. Just bring the devices together (typically back to back) and then touch your screen. The app determines what gets beamed.
When this feature is turned on, you can quickly enable accessibility features in two steps: Step 1: Press and hold the power button until you hear a sound or feel a vibration. Step 2: Touch and hold two fingers until you hear audio confirmation. If the device has multiple users, using this shortcut on the lock screen temporarily enables accessibility until the device is unlocked.
When this feature is turned on, your phone can communicate with other devices nearby. Broadcasting uses low-power Bluetooth signals.
This feature may cause an app that depends on background data to stop working when only cellular networks are available. You can find more appropriate data usage controls in the settings available within the app.

To help improve battery life, battery saver reduces your device’s performance and limits vibration, location services, and most background data. Email, messaging, and other apps that rely on syncing may not update unless you open them. Battery saver turns off automatically when your device is charging.
To improve location accuracy and for other purposes, Google and other apps may scan for nearby networks, even when Wi-Fi is off. If you don't want this to happen, go to Advanced ߘߦߝ Scanning always available.
